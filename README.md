# Video-Club-Project1LabP
A simplified version of a video club management system - a movie rental store. The entire stock management system will be done through CSV files.

The system will simulate the operation of a day in a video club. The user should initialize the video club according to a predetermined list of movies.

The system should allow the rental of available movies, the return of movies, the filtering of movies by price, release year and availability, the search by title and quota.

At the end of the day, after rentals and returns have been made, the system should update the movie stock, thus reflecting the number of movies rented and returned and inform the user what was the revenue and profit of the video club, according to the transactions that were made.
